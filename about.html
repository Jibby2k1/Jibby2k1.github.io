    <h1 class="h1">Background</h1>
    <p class="lead">I work at the intersection of signals & systems, controls, machine learning, and neuroengineering. I care about mathematically grounded models that stay useful when deployed in real pipelines (latency, noise, and real-world constraints).</p>
    <p class="lead">I attended Doral Academy Charter Middle/High School from 6th to 12th Grade, where I was active in Mu Alpha Theta, Zeta Omicron, Robotics Club, and Physics-Chemistry club. During these years, I attained many different national awards, especially in competitive math and robotics. Lastly, I was fortunate enough to attend Duke Tip, Awesome Math, and MathRoots Summer Camps.</p>
    <p class="lead">I am most passionate about neuroscience, powerbuilding, and music. Since I can remember I was passionate about music, growing up with my father playing yacht rock, prog rock and disco classics; music is now ingrained in my faily life where I ocassionally DJ and produce music. Powerbuilding is a hobby I've been interested in since high school simply as a discipline exercise. Neuroscience is the latest of my interests, especially for understanding how we can engineer solutions to biological shortcomings.</p>

    <p>Time-series ML theory and practice for biological signals (EEG, pupillometry, imaging). I build GPU-accelerated tooling when it materially improves iteration speed, reproducibility, and experiment throughput.</p>
